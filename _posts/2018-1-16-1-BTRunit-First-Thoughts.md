title: Intro to BTRunit
---

** Goals **

RUnit is the init system on a couple of small distros, and is much loved.
There's even a version provided by Busybox.

Downloading it is weird. Building it is weird. There are tarballs, but no
accessible source repo. Also the build system is super weird, and not very
configurable.

The ultimate goal of this project is to fix all compiler warnings,
change the build system out for autotools, and fix any hard-coded paths.
Other improvements might be made as time goes on.

** Where to get **

I started with Runit 2.1.2, downloaded from: http://smarden.org/runit/runit-2.1.2.tar.gz
